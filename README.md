# Design System challenge

Welcome to our exercise. During this test, you will be given the challenge to create a Select Menu component from scratch using React.

If you have any questions, please contact us for clarification, we're happy to help!

![Select Menu](select-menu.jpg)

## Instructions

1. **Clone** this repo to a location of your choosing.
2. Write your solution to the exercise, making sure you followed the specs carefully.
3. Push your solution to a **private repo** in your **personal Github account**.
4. When you are ready for us to take a look, add the user `adjust-frontend` as a collaborator to your repo.

## Exercise

Using the provided [specs](specs.png), create a reusable `Select Menu` component. For this exercise, we ask you to implement your own component and not use any ready solutions, like react-select, Material UI, etc.

- Your component should be written in React.
- You can choose between Javascript or Typescript.
- You can choose how to style your component.

### Bonus

- You can choose how to test your component.

## Expected result

We expect you to create a **reusable** component that can be easily integrated into any project.

Don't forget to add a documentation page with examples of the different use cases of your component, including instructions on how to use it and how to run your project locally.

Remember, the closer your component looks in comparison to the specs, the better ðŸ™‚

Good luck!
